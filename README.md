# Markbook

A markdown notebook app that relies on the file system, nothing crazy or clever.

The magic of this little app is really [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/NextStepWebs/simplemde-markdown-editor) which is a fantastic markdown editor with inline preview support.

This app isn't the prettiest code, but right now it works.  I wrote this app to fulfill a very specific need I had, which was treating a folder of markdown notes in a single UI.  I couldn't find anything quite like this already for the Mac, so I cobbled together what you see.  If you're on iOS 1Writer is the mental model which this is designed to match.

I will add features and functionality as they improve my workflow. Contributions are welcome, but please understand my primary goal is to keep this app simple.

The app is packaged on TravisCI and you can find the most current release on [GitHub's release page](https://github.com/stanlemon/markbook/releases).
